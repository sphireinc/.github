# Chronicler ‚Äì Developer-Friendly Structured Logging & Telemetry  

## Overview  
Chronicler is a **structured logging and telemetry library** for Go, designed to provide **high-performance, context-aware logs** with built-in support for **tracing, metrics, and observability**. It enables developers to track application behavior, debug efficiently, and gain insights into performance with minimal overhead.  

## Key Features  

### üìú Structured Logging  
- **JSON, plaintext, and custom log format support**  
- **Key-value structured logs** for easy filtering & analysis  
- **Log levels** (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal)  

### ‚è± Telemetry & Tracing  
- **Distributed tracing** support via OpenTelemetry  
- **Custom trace/span generation** for performance profiling  
- **Integration with Jaeger, Zipkin, and Prometheus**  

### üöÄ High Performance & Low Overhead  
- **Asynchronous log writing** to prevent blocking  
- **Batch processing & log compression** for efficiency  
- **Optimized for high-throughput applications**  

### üì° Integrations & Outputs  
- **Console, file, and cloud log storage** (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Loki, Elasticsearch)  
- **Hooks for third-party services** (e.g., Sentry, Datadog, Splunk)  
- **Easy integration with existing logging frameworks**  

## Use Cases  
‚úÖ **Centralized logging** for microservices & cloud-native apps  
‚úÖ **Debugging & error tracking** with structured logs  
‚úÖ **Performance monitoring** via built-in tracing support  
‚úÖ **Security & compliance logging** with retention policies  
‚úÖ **Seamless integration** with logging & observability platforms
