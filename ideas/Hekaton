# Hekaton ‚Äì High-Performance In-Memory Data Store for Go  

## Overview  
Hekaton is a **lightweight, high-performance in-memory data store** designed for **caching, real-time analytics, and ephemeral storage** in Go applications. It offers a **key-value storage engine** optimized for **speed and concurrency**, making it an ideal choice for **low-latency applications**.  

## Key Features  

### ‚ö° Blazing-Fast In-Memory Storage  
- **Optimized for low-latency data retrieval**  
- **Concurrent read/write operations** with minimal locking  
- **Support for TTL (Time-To-Live) expiration policies**  

### üèó Advanced Data Structures  
- **Key-value pairs**, **counters**, **queues**, and **hashmaps**  
- **LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction** for efficient memory management  
- **Atomic operations** for consistency in high-concurrency environments  

### üì° Persistence & Durability  
- **Optional disk persistence** (snapshot-based or WAL logging)  
- **Hybrid mode** (hot data in memory, cold data on disk)  
- **Backup & restore mechanisms** for crash recovery  

### üîÑ Distributed & Scalable  
- **Optional clustering support** with consistent hashing  
- **Leader-follower replication** for high availability  
- **Integration with external databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse)**  

## Use Cases  
‚úÖ **Application caching** (e.g., API responses, computed values)  
‚úÖ **Ephemeral storage** for session management & job queues  
‚úÖ **Real-time analytics & event streaming**  
‚úÖ **Fast data lookups & counters** for high-performance services  
‚úÖ **In-memory database alternative** for microservices
