# Tesseract – Go-Powered Event Sourcing Framework  

## Overview  
Tesseract is a **lightweight event-driven framework** for building **event-sourced applications** in Go. It provides **seamless integration with modern event streaming platforms** and offers a robust **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) model** for efficient data processing.  

## Key Features  

### ⚡ Scalable Event Sourcing  
- **Works with Kafka, NATS, and Pulsar** to store event streams reliably  
- **Ensures idempotency** by handling duplicate events effectively  
- **Optimized for high-throughput applications** with minimal latency  

### 🔄 Simple & Efficient CQRS Model  
- **Separates read and write operations** for better performance  
- **Supports event replaying** to reconstruct system state  
- **Ensures strong consistency** across distributed systems  

### 🏗️ Developer-Friendly API  
- **Minimal boilerplate** for quick adoption  
- **Extensible event handlers** for custom business logic  
- **Works seamlessly with Go’s native concurrency model**  

## Use Cases  
✅ **Build event-driven microservices** with scalable event storage  
✅ **Implement CQRS architectures** for complex applications  
✅ **Ensure auditability & traceability** with event logs  
✅ **Replay past events** to debug or recover system state  
✅ **Improve system reliability** with idempotent event processing
