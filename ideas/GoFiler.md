# GoFiler – Universal Filesystem Abstraction for Go  

## Overview  
GoFiler is a **cross-platform filesystem abstraction** for Go, designed to simplify file operations across **Linux, macOS, and Windows**. It provides a **consistent API** for handling **local, remote, and virtual filesystems**, allowing developers to write file-related code **once** without worrying about OS-specific quirks.  

## Key Features  

### 📁 Unified Filesystem API  
- Abstracts **file operations** across different OS platforms  
- Provides a **unified interface** for local, cloud, and in-memory storage  
- **Consistent path handling** across Linux, macOS, and Windows  

### 🌐 Support for Remote & Virtual Filesystems  
- Built-in support for **S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage**  
- Secure **SSHFS and SFTP** support  
- **In-memory filesystem** for testing & temporary file storage  

### 🛠️ Advanced File Utilities  
- **Atomic file writes** & transactional file operations  
- **Efficient file streaming** (read/write large files without memory overhead)  
- **Custom file adapters** for integrating with proprietary storage solutions  

### 🔒 Security & Access Controls  
- **Filesystem sandboxing** (restrict file access to specific directories)  
- **Automatic encryption & compression** options  
- **Built-in ACL & permission handling**  

## Use Cases  
✅ Build **cross-platform** applications with unified file handling  
✅ Integrate **cloud storage** without changing core file logic  
✅ Create **virtual filesystems** for testing environments  
✅ Securely **manage and access remote files** via SSH, S3, or Blob storage  
✅ Develop **plugins and tools** requiring filesystem abstraction
